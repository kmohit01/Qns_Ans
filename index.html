                A backend developer is a type of programmer who specializes in building and maintaining the server-side of web
                applications. While frontend developers focus on creating the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that users
                interact with in their web browsers, backend developers work on the behind-the-scenes functionality that powers the
                application and handles tasks such as data processing, database management, and server-side logic.
